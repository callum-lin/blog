    <h1>Noughts and Crosses</h1>
    <p>
      A alluringly simple game of Noughts and Crosses - or tic-tac-toe depending
      on where you come from - is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game">solved game.</a> It is
      never possible to lose and the best you can play is a draw, except where
      your opponent or you blunders which seems to be more common than you may
      think.
    </p>

    <br />
    A moment of lost concentration could cost you the game.
    <br />
    <p>
      A strong solution to noughts-and-crosses can be easily coded, given the
      lack of complexity in the game. The upper bound of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_tree">game tree</a> is only 3‚Åπ
      (19,683). This number drops even further because of early terminations,
      where a winner is already found before all 9 boxes are filled, and invalid
      moves such as all X's resulting in an upper bound of only
      <a
        href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/485752/tictactoe-state-space-choose-calculation/486548#486548"
        >5,478</a
      >, this number drops even further when rotations and reflections are taken
      into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_factor"
        >branching factor</a
      >
      is also important to look at: in chess there are on

        >average 31 possible moves</a
      >
      for each state but in our noughts and crosses game the number is only 4
      (9//2). The resultant game state is really small and makes the game ideal
      for AI's to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means the game is also trivial for humans because you can afford to
      look over 3 moves ahead with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning"
        >pruning</a
      >, where some game tree branches are immediately rejected because they
      lead to immediate loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start with i instantiate the board and create functions directly
      relating to the current state of the board. The most important function to
      take note of here is the <code>evaluate(board)</code> function, which
      negates the score depending on the side to play. i.e. when white is to
      play and has won, a score of 1 is returned, but when white is won and
      black is to play, a negated score of -1 is returned instead and vice
      versa. For draws a value of 0 is returned.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
board = [[" ", " ", " "] for i in range(3)]

    noughts = sum(row.count("O") for row in board)

      Now that i have board representation the next step is to create the search
      algorithim. Here i will use
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax">negamax</a> search, where
      each player maximises their expected gains at each stage - taking into
      account that in noughts and crosses your gains are my loss so the sign is
      flipped in each stage. i.e. Pick the best move which is the move that
      harms my opponent the most. This is not unlike the
      <code>evaluation(board)</code> function above.
    </p>
    <p>
      For further reading by people more experienced at communication than i am,
      see
      <a href="https://estherk15.medium.com/minimax-7c177beec09a">this post</a>
      by Esther where she dives into the basics of minimax search. After this
      you should be able to realise that negamax search is simply minimax search
      but with sign reversal instead of minimising.

      For my negamax search i took a code extract from the
      <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Negamax"
        >chess programming wiki's negamax page</a
      >
      and adapted it to my own needs. The function returns the best_move as a
      tuple (row, column) which is not (y, x).

      In just under a hundred lines of code, we already have a fully functional
      game. We can make moves, unmake moves and even find the best move using
      negamax search. Hopefully you can see the actual search itself is very
      small with the most lines of code so far going towards finding out the
      state of the game.

    <p>
      For our user interface, i defined the following 3 functions. A function to
      test if a move was valid to avoid an invalid board state. Additionally, i
      needed to be able to generate a random move for the AI to play to keep it
      interesting. The function
      <code>return_list_of_won_squares(board)</code> is used to highlight the
      squares that are won for the graphical user interface.

    <p>
      Now with both the board logic coded and helper functions, i started to
      code up the interactive game itself. There were several features i really
      wanted in my game but most of all, i tried to make it look good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made the decision for the AI to go first, while it would certainly not
      be difficult to add an option to reverse the roles, or even to let the AI
      play against itself, both options which i had done in testing - i felt it
      was out of scope for this very small game which was mainly focused on
      minimax search with a game we all love and enjoy.

      This yielded me a very pretty command line user interface and as the AI
      generated a random move each time the program is called - it added much
      needed variety to the game. This was the best addition because it got
      boring after each day of testing!

      The main features in the graphical game was highlighting squares captured
      in the example above, i also added highlight on hover which made it feel
      far more interactive command to the terminal based version.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ironic thing being that the graphical interface was easier to do than
      the command line interface and in fewer lines of code as well! This was
      due to having to do more io compared to the graphical interface such as
      but not including handling

      , pretty printing and error catching.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started off by exploring minimax search in the context of noughts and
      crosses. In just over 100 lines of code, we explored how it was possible
      to get down all the logic for solving the game. Using this foundation, i
      made a small command line interface for the AI, this was satisfactory but
      after that i decided to make a graphical interface which turned out to be
      more than i could have expected!
    </p>
    <p>
      If this gains any traction there are so many more future plans such as
      adding AI against AI play, pretty printing (color), two players and more
      optimisations! The historical code listing for this can be found
